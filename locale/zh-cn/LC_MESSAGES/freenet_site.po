"### 6\\. Isn't censorship sometimes necessary?\n"
"\n"
"Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that\n"
"censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some\n"
"European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is illegal.\n"
"Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which are deemed\n"
"damaging to society. There are two answers to this however. The first is that\n"
"you can't allow those in power to impose \"good\" censorship, without also\n"
"enabling them to impose \"bad\" censorship. To impose any form of censorship a\n"
"government must have the ability to monitor and thus restrict communication.\n"
"There are already criticisms that the anti-racism censorship in many European\n"
"countries is hampering legitimate historical analysis of events such as the\n"
"second world war.\n"
"\n"
"The second argument is that this \"good\" censorship is counter-productive even\n"
"when it does not leak into other areas. For example, it is generally more\n"
"effective when trying to persuade someone of something to present them with\n"
"the arguments against it, and then answer those arguments. Unfortunately,\n"
"preventing people from being aware of the often sophisticated arguments used\n"
"by racists, makes them vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually\n"
"encounter them.\n"
"\n"
"Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would still hold-true\n"
"even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you either have censorship,\n"
"or you don't. There is no middle-ground."
msgstr "### 6\\. 有时审查制度不是必须的吗？\n\n所有问题都不是非黑即白的，很多人都认为在某些情况下审查制度是个好东西。例如，在某些欧洲国家，传播种族主义信息是违法的。政府寻求阻止此思想的宣扬，以免破坏社会。但对此行为有两种争论。首先，您不能确保当权者实施“好的”审查制度，而不实施“坏的”审查制度。要实施任何形式的审查制度，政府一定拥有监视和限制沟通的权力。在很多欧洲国家已经有对种族主义审查制度的批评，它阻止了合理的对历史事件的分析（如第二次世界大战）。\n\n第二种争论是，即使“好的”审查制度没有渗入其他领域，它仍然会起到反作用。例如，通常来说，将争议摆在桌面，回答这些争议，更容易说服某人。不幸的是，虽然阻止了人们了解种族主义分子的争议，但当他们最终遇到这些争论时，他们会变得更加脆弱。\n\n当然第一种争论是最强的，即使您不接受第二种争论，它也是正确的。根本上，要么存在审查制度，要么不存在。不存在中间的情况。"

"### 7\\. But why is anonymity necessary?\n"
"\n"
"You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous.\n"
"Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail free\n"
"speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than preventing\n"
"them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent this is to\n"
"remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot trust\n"
"anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital signatures\n"
"people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can\n"
"learn to trust. Freenet incorporates a mechanism called \"subspaces\" to\n"
"facilitate this."
msgstr "### 7\\. 但是为何需要匿名？\n\n如果您无法匿名，您不可能拥有言论自由。大部分的审查是可追溯的。在发表言论后再惩罚相关人员，比在言论发表第一时间处理更容易。唯一可避免惩罚的方式就是保持匿名。有一个常见的误解是，匿名信息不可信。这不一定是正确的。使用数字签名，人们可以创建一个安全的笔名，他人可以去信任这个笔名。Freenet 引入了“子空间（Subspaces）”的机制来使之成为可能。"

"### 8\\. And what of copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of\n"
"copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with\n"
"copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of communications,\n"
"and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is monitoring everything\n"
"you say. This is important, most people fail to see or address this point\n"
"when debating the issue of copyright, so let me make it clear:\n"
"\n"
"> *You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law*\n"
"\n"
"It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of\n"
"Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright."
msgstr "### 8\\. 版权又将怎样？\n\nFreenet 的很多媒体报道都关注它带来的版权问题，因此我在这里简单说一下。版权的核心问题在于，为了保护版权，就需要监视通讯。如果某人监视了您所说的一切，您的言论自由就无法保障。这非常重要，在人们争论保护版权的问题时，往往忽略了这一点。因此，我再次强调：\n\n> *您无法在保证言论自由的同时实施版权法*\n\n这就是 Freenet——一个被设计为保护言论自由的系统——拒绝保护版权的原因。"

"### 9\\. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be rewarded\n"
"for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more important than\n"
"having professional artists (those who claim that we would have no art do not\n"
"understand creativity: people will always create, it is a compulsion,\n"
"the only question is whether they can do it for a living).\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is effective even now. The\n"
"music industry is one of the most vocally opposed to enhancements in\n"
"communication technology, yet according to many of the artists who should be\n"
"rewarded by copyright, it is failing to do so. Rather it has allowed\n"
"middle-men to gain control over the mechanisms of distribution, to the\n"
"detriment of both artists and the public."
msgstr "### 9\\. 但若艺术家的工作没有版权，他们如何得到回报？\n\n首先，即使版权是艺术家从其作品获得回报的唯一方式，我主张自由比拥有专业艺术家更重要（那些声称我们没有艺术细胞不懂得创新的人：人们总是在创新，这是种冲动，唯一的问题是他们是不是考创新生存的）。\n\n其次，甚至到现在，版权是否起作用也是值得怀疑的。音乐产业就是一个典型的例子。在不断提高的通讯技术下，音乐文件得到广泛自由的传播，但是应当从版权得到丰厚回报的艺术家们，并没有。版权让中间人控制了发行机制，同时损害了艺术家和公众的利益。"

"pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. If\n"

"The Freenet team is very happy to announce the stable release of Freenet 0.7.5 build 1468.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the \"node.updater.URI\" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"In this release, the way Freenet stores data locally has changed drastically by no longer using the now-deprecated db4o object storage. It is replaced with the product of toad's summer of work - a custom on-disk format that is much more robust against corruption and more efficient.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Existing unfinished downloads and uploads will be imported to a new format, which requires restarting them from the beginning.</li>\n"
"<li>Space for downloads is now all allocated at the start, so machines very low on disk space may run out, which causes downloads to temporarily fail until more space is available.</li>\n"
"<li>CHKs will change due to metadata bugfixes.</li>\n"
"<li>Some unofficial plugins will need to be updated because of API changes. Sone already works, as do all official plugins.</li>\n"
"<li>The queue format changes should make it extremely rare to lose the entire queue: the impact of corruption will almost always be localized.</li>\n"
"<li>Multi-container / site uploads can now be persistent, making it more practical to upload large sites.</li>\n"
"<li>Passworded physical security is now much stronger. (Full-disk encryption is still preferable.)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The Windows installer now defaults to starting Freenet on login.</li>\n"
"<li>There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/freenet/wintray\">new Windows tray app</a> with some useful features that is included with new installations. If you are using the existing Windows tray app you can download the new one <a href=\"https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/installer/FreenetTray.exe.build01468\">here</a>. No need to put it in a specific directory - it will try the default installation location and prompt if it can't find it.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The list of download keys moved from downloads/listFetchKeys.txt to downloads/listKeys.txt.</li>\n"
"<li>A list of upload keys is now available at uploads/listKeys.txt</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Gantros' index is now in the default bookmarks. It uses the same software as Enzo's index, which is no longer updated.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>The obsolete and deprecated XMLLibrary and XMLSpider plugins are no longer officially supported. They will still load for those who have them added, but are no longer shown on the plugin page.</li>\n"
"<li>In the interests of releasing this build more quickly, the new version of FlogHelper does not support exporting and importing backups from the web UI. The old backup code did not work with the new Freenet version after removing db4o. People can instead back up \"plugins.floghelper.FlogHelper\" files in the plugin-data directory. These can be dropped into the directory after unloading FlogHelper to restore a backup.</li>\n"
"<li>ThawIndexBrowser works again. Thanks saces!</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Fred translations are updated.</li>\n"

"That means it is now possible to get reproducibly built kernels checked by anonymous (and therefore hard to pressure) contributors and update them over Freenet without disclosing that you use them. This applies to the packages provided by Mempo - other apt-get activity like installing GIMP is still public. It would be possible to host the entire Debian repository in Freenet, but this is not yet on the agenda for Mempo because this other activity does not disclose the potentially sensitive information that you want additional privacy.\n"
"\n"
"> The practical cool result now, is that Mempo repository can not be censored, DDoSed or taken offline, despite having just 1 tiny server (or no server at all) - rfreeman (one of the mempo developers)"

"This release is planned to be the second-to-last version of Freenet to support Java 6\\. The version after this one will refuse to upgrade unless running on Java 7 or later. Support for this behavior is part of a larger effort to allow separate official update channels - stable, testing, and unstable - as well as make it easier to publish unofficial update channels and further improve deployment security.\n"
"\n"
"Highlights for this build:\n"
"\n"
"*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)\n"
"*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop][url_bug3208].\n"
"*   Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has [more math behind it][url_peermath] and will change when network parameters are adjusted.\n"
"*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!\n"
"*   This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally Matthew's (toad_'s) summer work on a custom on-disk format is done. This release lays the groundwork to include the results of that work [in the next release][url_toad]. This is designed for less disk activity and better behavior when corrupted.\n"
"\n"
"This release coincides with the 25th anniversary of the demolition of the Berlin wall (Mauerfall), which marked the beginning of the end of a large censorship and surveillance regime. May censorship be demolished everywhere!\n"

"According to [the press](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/), half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.\n"
"\n"
"This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html).\n"
"\n"
"On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#tor).\n"
"\n"
"Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major \"darknets\" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend \"darknet\". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.\n"
"\n"
"We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.\n"
"\n"
"Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!\n"
"\n"
"Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the \"freenet\" board on FMS.\n"

"Long time coder xor (also known as p0s) has agreed to work, in a paid role, for us on fixing the Web of Trust plugin. This is a crucial component of many Freenet plugins:\n"
"\n"
"*   **Sone**, an anonymous social network / microblogging tool.\n"
"*   **Freemail**, a private and untraceable email over Freenet system.\n"
"*   A filesharing system as yet unnamed which a student is working on.\n"
"*   Extensions to Infocalypse, being worked on by another student, a tool for managing source code which is vital to developing software over Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"See the Freenet Social Networking Guide for how to load the first 2 plugins.\n"
"\n"
"xor is well qualified for the role as he wrote most of the current code in the Web of Trust. The immediate priority will be to improve stability and performance by implementing a new more efficient FCP API. After that further optimisations are planned.\n"
"\n"
"Freenet relies on unpaid volunteer developers as well as a few key paid developers. Toad (Matthew Toseland) is returning to full time work for Freenet after a study break, although he is off to university in October, and xor is just starting working for Freenet.\n"
"\n"
"Improving the Web of Trust should substantially improve the performance of the key tools mentioned above and may be used by more in the future. Thanks to all our developers and donors!"

"Some academics [have published](http://www.ee.hawaii.edu/~dong/traceback/index.htm) a couple of attacks against Freenet, and they appear to be working on more as part of a project to unmask anonymous Freenet users. Build 1411, which was released on the 3rd of September, makes their main attack largely impractical. Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the [other known attacks](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#attack). You can learn more about the attacks and our solution to them on our chief developer's [personal blog](http://amphibian.dyndns.org/flogmirror/#20120911-security).\n"
"\n"
"We welcome all work to understand Freenet's security and expose any problems with it, although we would suggest that next time they might let us know before they make the paper public, as is common practice in the security community.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the long term solution is to build a darknet, a Freenet network where people only connect directly to people they trust. That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack."
