(This news item was not published until July 16th. Sorry for the delay.)

Freenet 0.7.5 build 1475 is now available.
Build 1474 was an emergency release which [fixed a denial of service attack][announcement1474] which prevented the node from processing other requests after processing a malicious request.
This build contains the months of work which were not included in the emergency release.
It will become mandatory on July 15th.

Highlights:

- Warn that Java 7 is End of Life. (Please update!)
- Improve load balancing.
- Add support for HTML5 audio tags.
- Fix a major bug that might explain the poor connectivity since 1473.

_("""
Documents initially made public by the Missouri police department
describe their efforts on tracking Freenet usage.  Using a simple
scheme, they claim a near zero false positive rate for
tracking the originator of a download.  While we applaud all public
documentation on attacks, we have to point out that the claimed
effectiveness of their attacks is based solely on flawed mathematics.
In reality, the false positive rate of their method is at least 83%,
and close to 100% in real world scenarios.

The claimed effectiveness of their attack is based on a false
assumption about the distribution of the HTL of incoming requests.  HTL (Hops
to Live) is a number embedded in each request that is usually
decremented when the request is forwarded, starting at a value of 18
at the originator of the request, and serves to limit the number of
hops a request can survive on the network.  As a security precaution,
the HTL is decremented probabilistically on the first few hops.  In
their tracking efforts, the Missouri police department assumes that
when multiple requests for pieces of a file arrive from a single node,
and all these requests have HTL 18 with no requests at HTL 17 or 16,
this node must be the originator of the requests, with a false
positive probability decreasing with the number of requests received
from the node.  This would be true if whether the HTL is
decremented is decided per request, which has historically been the
case in the early days of Freenet.  The vulnerability they claim to
exploit was however addressed in 2008 (last touched in [this
commit][commithtl18]).  Whether the HTL is decremented is since
decided per connection, so any probability they claim using the
aforementioned method is false.

For every connection there is a 50% chance that all the HTL 18 requests
(not only a single one, as would be the case with per-request
probabilistic decrementing) did not originate from the node from which
we received them but were forwarded one step. So for 10 connections
(the lowest number of peers Freenet uses), there are on average 5
other nodes whose HTL 18 requests are forwarded with HTL 18, so the
probability that a given HTL 18 request originated at the node from
which we received it is only about 17% (1 in 6). If the node has more
connections (close to 30 is common), this probability is even lower. And
this probability does not get higher when gathering more requests of
chunks from a specific file or a specific kind of files, because they
can reasonably all be forwarded from a different node — the one which
really sent them.

The heterogenity of the network and routing with second-level
connections taken into account does not easily yield robust
statistical claims without knowing the peers of peers of the node
under investigation. Staying connected for a long time might allow for
distinguishing between the changing peers of the node and requests
originating at the node itself, but with significant cost.

If the node which is tracked has friend-to-friend peers
(which unlike automatically added peers do not change regularly), even waiting
will not allow finding out with the described method whether HTL 18 requests came from the
node itself or from the peers connected over
friend-to-friend connections.

For details, see [the code][codehtl18].

This does not make it impossible to track Freenet users who use only
Opennet mode (connecting to strangers), since a network where nodes
connect to strangers is inherently susceptible to Sybil attacks,
where nodes of typical users are outnumbered by malicious, colluding nodes.

The only way to defend against serious attacks is to *use Freenet in
Friend-to-Friend mode*, where the precondition to tracking a user is
social engineering to get the people to whom he/she is connected to
betray the user. The need to defend against this type of attack is
the reason why the core of Freenet was rewritten in 2007 to add this
Friend-to-Friend mode (called Darknet mode).

However the method used by the Missouri police department is using
false statistics: despite its flaws, Freenet's Opennet is much harder to
track than they claim.

The Freenet developers do not condemn these attacks. Police departments
try to use every legal venue to catch criminals. This is their job and
vocation, but any attack they find could also be used by oppressive
governments to suppress dissenting opinions, so we will work to fix attacks
as they come to light.
We expect law enforcement to get their math right, especially when using
it in court. If they can get a warrant with an 83% false positive
rate, that's a problem for lawmakers. If they falsely claim a 0% false
positive rate, that's eroding the trust of citizens in the legal
system.

Additional information on this attack is available from the
[mailing list discussion][mlhtl18].

The mission of the Freenet Project is to safeguard freedom of the
press by providing censorship resistant communication. This requires
protecting people against being targeted for what they write or
read. To achieve this, Freenet enables users to publish anonymous
websites and offers chat, forums, and file-sharing, as well as
confidential communication among friends and methods to leverage the
capabilities of Freenet from other tools.

When the police spread misinformation about the security of Freenet, it
directly undermines our mission by driving users to networks which
cannot provide a comparable level of security for
whistle-blowers and those wishing to publish anonymously.

Freenet 0.7.5 build 1473 is now available. This is the first build to require
Java 7! It upgrades Bouncy Castle to version 1.54, and adds a Traditional

Plugin updates:

* Add Sharesite - a fork of ShareWiki - as an official plugin. Thanks to
  ArneBab for getting it ready! It includes an earlier version of TextileJ to
  avoid license problems, and adds syntax help, external activelink support, and
  a template with div IDs for easier CSS.
* Update Freereader with the ability to configure the site title and subtitle,
  and fix the translation support.

User-facing core change highlights:

* Improve MP3 filtering.
* Add The Filtered Index to the default bookmark list.
* Fix handling of filenames with non-ASCII spaces.
* Alphabetize language configuration dropdown.
* Add Hungarian translation support. The translation was added previously but not
  actually available.
* Fix dropping low-traffic connections. This helps with simulations.
* Optimize FProxy CSS load order, and fix bugs which prevented caching static
  assets. This improves web interface responsiveness.

This is the last build to support Java 6! The next build will require Java 7 or higher. Nodes running Java 7 or higher and using the official update key will now use a new update key. Nodes on Java 6 remain using the old update key and will not be updated to further builds. Thanks to yadevel for fixing the regression this release was blocking on!

This version was initially partially released as build 1471 - it was released on GitHub but not offered from the website or auto-update. Build 1472 fixes a bug which when using Java 6 prevented nodes from starting for the first time. It did not break existing installations.

Highlights:

- Fix uploads stalling when using MAXIMUM physical security.
- Fix lots of "setNativePriority(X) has failed!", which was caused by a serious thread priority problem. This might fix nodes unexpectedly losing peers.
- Order alerts within a category by time: if you have lots of messages from darknet peers they will remain nicely sorted.
- There is now a [caching layer][caching] which should significantly reduce I/O load.
- Update WebOfTrust from build 15 to build 18. [Its][wot16] [changelogs][wot17] [are][wot18] separate, but the changes reduce CPU load. Incremental score recomputation requires roughly 3 percent of the time of full recomputation, and queuing trust lists to disk lowers thread usage.

Translations:

- Add partial Greek translation.
- Update German, Bokmål, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and  Traditional Chinese translations.
- Fix Bokmål localization loading.

Also:

- Remove Gantros Index from the default bookmark list because it stopped updating.
- Remove Linkageddon from the default bookmark list because it stopped updating.
- New version of UPnP to fix some instability and compatibility problems. Thanks to 007pig we have a [new UPnP plugin][upnp2] in development which supports UPnP2, but it is not yet included.
- New version of KeyUtils.

WebOfTrust now has an updatable testing version built and maintained by xor. To use it, unload WebOfTrust, then load "WebOfTrust Testing Versions" on the Plugins page. Versions built by xor will not work with Java 6.

Sites can set favicons with `<link rel="icon" type=... href=...>`. (`type` could be `"image/x-icon"`)

Extensive review and improvement of English source strings and French and Spanish translations. Tests for and fixes of value substitution in translations. Thanks Vaughan Woodzell!

The default theme is now sky-static instead of clean-dropdown. This looks less outdated, though not modern.

Fix default bookmarks missing the "software" category since build 1470. If you don't see this category please re-add the default bookmark set from the bookmark editing page.

IpToCountry database is updated. (This allows providing the country flags on the peers pages. It is local to each instance and does not contact an external service.)

Add partial CSS3 support, including viewport lengths. Thanks, Ben Green!

<p>
Despite being in some form of prerelease for over 6 months, and two weeks of
being available as a release candidate, we didn't catch some bugs in time. There
are two main issues:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Because the reimplementation of the client layer without db4o did not include
prioritization of FEC decoding / encoding, large bulk download or upload queues
can starve the realtime queues, making them unresponsive.
(See <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/381">PR #381</a>.)
</li>
<li>
Due to our misunderstanding of when the cryptography library we use - Bouncy
Castle - included which fixes, we did not realize that version 1.51, used by
build 1468, has severe performance problems with the way we use it to implement
disk encryption. Build 1469 will upgrade to Bouncy Castle 1.52, which fixes this
problem. It is only an issue when the physical security level is set to "Low" or
higher. It does not happen when physical security is set to "None."
(See <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/382">PR #382</a>.)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sadly, these problems can combine to make a node use 100% CPU to slowly process
bulk queues while the realtime queue does not respond. Matthew (toad_) has
already released a snapshot to fix these problems, which you can find

<p>
The Freenet team is very happy to announce the stable release of Freenet 0.7.5 build 1468.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the "node.updater.URI" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.

<p>
In this release, the way Freenet stores data locally has changed drastically by no longer using the now-deprecated db4o object storage. It is replaced with the product of toad's summer of work - a custom on-disk format that is much more robust against corruption and more efficient.

<li>The obsolete and deprecated XMLLibrary and XMLSpider plugins are no longer officially supported. They will still load for those who have them added, but are no longer shown on the plugin page.</li>
<li>In the interests of releasing this build more quickly, the new version of FlogHelper does not support exporting and importing backups from the web UI.

*   Update WebOfTrust with bug fixes and a new API.

What remains to be done:

*   <del>Finish reviewing the synchronous plugin communication API. Review is split between [GitHub](https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/319) and more recently the [development mailing list](https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2015-February/037986.html).</del> -- Done 2015-03-28
*   Update all plugins (KeyUtils and WebOfTrust are already ready) for the API breakage in this version.
*   Add a .NET 3.5 install to the Windows installer, along with the new tray app. (This is necessary for it to always work for those not on Windows 7.)
*   Everything on [this list](https://bugs.freenetproject.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=85).

Key Points:

*   use Freenet to distribute online updates
*   most secure hosting option

That means it is now possible to get reproducibly built kernels checked by anonymous (and therefore hard to pressure) contributors and update them over Freenet without disclosing that you use them. This applies to the packages provided by Mempo - other apt-get activity like installing GIMP is still public. It would be possible to host the entire Debian repository in Freenet, but this is not yet on the agenda for Mempo because this other activity does not disclose the potentially sensitive information that you want additional privacy.

This release is planned to be the second-to-last version of Freenet to support Java 6\. The version after this one will refuse to upgrade unless running on Java 7 or later. Support for this behavior is part of a larger effort to allow separate official update channels - stable, testing, and unstable - as well as make it easier to publish unofficial update channels and further improve deployment security.

Highlights for this build:

*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)
*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop][url_bug3208].
*   Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has [more math behind it][url_peermath] and will change when network parameters are adjusted.
*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!
*   This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.

Additionally Matthew's (toad_'s) summer work on a custom on-disk format is done. This release lays the groundwork to include the results of that work [in the next release][url_toad]. This is designed for less disk activity and better behavior when corrupted.

This release coincides with the 25th anniversary of the demolition of the Berlin wall (Mauerfall), which marked the beginning of the end of a large censorship and surveillance regime. May censorship be demolished everywhere!

                 _("""
According to [the press](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/), half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.

This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html).

On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/FAQ#How_is_Freenet_different_to_Tor.3F_Can_I_access_Google.2FFacebook.2Fetc_through_Freenet.3F).

Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.

Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major "darknets" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.

Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend "darknet". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.

We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.

Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!

Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the "freenet" board on FMS.

Long time coder xor (also known as p0s) has agreed to work, in a paid role, for us on fixing the Web of Trust plugin. This is a crucial component of many Freenet plugins:

*   **Sone**, an anonymous social network / microblogging tool.
*   **Freemail**, a private and untraceable email over Freenet system.
*   A filesharing system as yet unnamed which a student is working on.
*   Extensions to Infocalypse, being worked on by another student, a tool for managing source code which is vital to developing software over Freenet.

See the Freenet Social Networking Guide for how to load the first 2 plugins.

xor is well qualified for the role as he wrote most of the current code in the Web of Trust. The immediate priority will be to improve stability and performance by implementing a new more efficient FCP API. After that further optimisations are planned.

Freenet relies on unpaid volunteer developers as well as a few key paid developers. Toad (Matthew Toseland) is returning to full time work for Freenet after a study break, although he is off to university in October, and xor is just starting working for Freenet.

Improving the Web of Trust should substantially improve the performance of the key tools mentioned above and may be used by more in the future. Thanks to all our developers and donors!

Some academics [have published](http://www.ee.hawaii.edu/~dong/traceback/index.htm) a couple of attacks against Freenet, and they appear to be working on more as part of a project to unmask anonymous Freenet users. Build 1411, which was released on the 3rd of September, makes their main attack largely impractical. Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the [other known attacks](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/FAQ#Major_known_attacks). You can learn more about the attacks and our solution to them on our chief developer's [personal blog](http://amphibian.dyndns.org/flogmirror/#20120911-security).

We welcome all work to understand Freenet's security and expose any problems with it, although we would suggest that next time they might let us know before they make the paper public, as is common practice in the security community.

Finally, the long term solution is to build a darknet, a Freenet network where people only connect directly to people they trust. That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack.
