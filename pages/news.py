been the seednodes because other opennet connections are neither

<p>
Despite being in some form of prerelease for over 6 months, and two weeks of
being available as a release candidate, we didn't catch some bugs in time. There
are two main issues:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Because the reimplementation of the client layer without db4o did not include
prioritization of FEC decoding / encoding, large bulk download or upload queues
can starve the realtime queues, making them unresponsive.
(See <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/381">PR #381</a>.)
</li>
<li>
Due to our misunderstanding of when the cryptography library we use - Bouncy
Castle - included which fixes, we did not realize that version 1.51, used by
build 1468, has severe performance problems with the way we use it to implement
disk encryption. Build 1469 will upgrade to Bouncy Castle 1.52, which fixes this
problem. It is only an issue when the physical security level is set to "Low" or
higher. It does not happen when physical security is set to "None."
(See <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/382">PR #382</a>.)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sadly, these problems can combine to make a node use 100% CPU to slowly process
bulk queues while the realtime queue does not respond. Matthew (toad_) has
already released a snapshot to fix these problems, which you can find
<a href="https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2015-July/038123.html">on the mailing list</a>

<p>
The Freenet team is very happy to announce the stable release of Freenet 0.7.5 build 1468.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the "node.updater.URI" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.
</p>

<p>
In this release, the way Freenet stores data locally has changed drastically by no longer using the now-deprecated db4o object storage. It is replaced with the product of toad's summer of work - a custom on-disk format that is much more robust against corruption and more efficient.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Existing unfinished downloads and uploads will be imported to a new format, which requires restarting them from the beginning.</li>
<li>Space for downloads is now all allocated at the start, so machines very low on disk space may run out, which causes downloads to temporarily fail until more space is available.</li>
<li>CHKs will change due to metadata bugfixes.</li>
<li>Some unofficial plugins will need to be updated because of API changes. Sone already works, as do all official plugins.</li>
<li>The queue format changes should make it extremely rare to lose the entire queue: the impact of corruption will almost always be localized.</li>
<li>Multi-container / site uploads can now be persistent, making it more practical to upload large sites.</li>
<li>Passworded physical security is now much stronger. (Full-disk encryption is still preferable.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Windows installer now defaults to starting Freenet on login.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="https://github.com/freenet/wintray">new Windows tray app</a> with some useful features that is included with new installations. If you are using the existing Windows tray app you can download the new one <a href="https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/installer/FreenetTray.exe.build01468">here</a>. No need to put it in a specific directory - it will try the default installation location and prompt if it can't find it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The list of download keys moved from downloads/listFetchKeys.txt to downloads/listKeys.txt.</li>
<li>A list of upload keys is now available at uploads/listKeys.txt</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Gantros' index is now in the default bookmarks. It uses the same software as Enzo's index, which is no longer updated.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The obsolete and deprecated XMLLibrary and XMLSpider plugins are no longer officially supported. They will still load for those who have them added, but are no longer shown on the plugin page.</li>
<li>In the interests of releasing this build more quickly, the new version of FlogHelper does not support exporting and importing backups from the web UI. The old backup code did not work with the new Freenet version after removing db4o. People can instead back up "plugins.floghelper.FlogHelper" files in the plugin-data directory. These can be dropped into the directory after unloading FlogHelper to restore a backup.</li>
<li>ThawIndexBrowser works again. Thanks saces!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fred translations are updated.</li>

This release is planned to be the second-to-last version of Freenet to support Java 6\. The version after this one will refuse to upgrade unless running on Java 7 or later. Support for this behavior is part of a larger effort to allow separate official update channels - stable, testing, and unstable - as well as make it easier to publish unofficial update channels and further improve deployment security.

Highlights for this build:

*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)
*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop](https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=3208).
*   Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has [more math behind it](https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/286) and will change when network parameters are adjusted.
*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!
*   This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.

According to [the press](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/), half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.

This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html).

On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#tor).

Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.

Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major "darknets" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.

Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend "darknet". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.

We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.

Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!

Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the "freenet" board on FMS.

For press enquiries please contact [Ian Clarke](mailto:ian@freenetproject.org).

                 _("""
Long time coder xor (also known as p0s) has agreed to work, in a paid role, for us on fixing the Web of Trust plugin. This is a crucial component of many Freenet plugins:

*   **Sone**, an anonymous social network / microblogging tool.
*   **Freemail**, a private and untraceable email over Freenet system.
*   A filesharing system as yet unnamed which a student is working on.
*   Extensions to Infocalypse, being worked on by another student, a tool for managing source code which is vital to developing software over Freenet.

See the Freenet Social Networking Guide for how to load the first 2 plugins.

xor is well qualified for the role as he wrote most of the current code in the Web of Trust. The immediate priority will be to improve stability and performance by implementing a new more efficient FCP API. After that further optimisations are planned.

Freenet relies on unpaid volunteer developers as well as a few key paid developers. Toad (Matthew Toseland) is returning to full time work for Freenet after a study break, although he is off to university in October, and xor is just starting working for Freenet.

Improving the Web of Trust should substantially improve the performance of the key tools mentioned above and may be used by more in the future. Thanks to all our developers and donors!

                 _("""
Some academics [have published](http://www.ee.hawaii.edu/~dong/traceback/index.htm) a couple of attacks against Freenet, and they appear to be working on more as part of a project to unmask anonymous Freenet users. Build 1411, which was released on the 3rd of September, makes their main attack largely impractical. Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the [other known attacks](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#attack). You can learn more about the attacks and our solution to them on our chief developer's [personal blog](http://amphibian.dyndns.org/flogmirror/#20120911-security).

We welcome all work to understand Freenet's security and expose any problems with it, although we would suggest that next time they might let us know before they make the paper public, as is common practice in the security community.

Finally, the long term solution is to build a darknet, a Freenet network where people only connect directly to people they trust. That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack.
