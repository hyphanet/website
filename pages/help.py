Freenet is a platform for censorship-resistant communication and

the Internet. It allows anybody to publish and read information with
complete anonymity. Nobody controls Freenet, not even its creators, meaning
that the system is not vulnerable to manipulation or shutdown. Freenet
is also very efficient in how it deals with information, adaptively
replicating content in response to demand.  For more information,

Freenet is a self-contained network, while Tor allows accessing the web
anonymously, as well as using "hidden services" (anonymous web servers).
Freenet is not a proxy: You cannot connect to services like Google or
Facebook using Freenet. However, Freenet has websites, filesharing, forums,
chat, microblogging, email etc, all anonymous and hosted within Freenet.

Freenet is a distributed datastore, so once content is uploaded to Freenet,
it will remain on Freenet forever, as long as it remains popular, without
fear of censorship or denial of service attacks, and without needing to run
your own web server and keep it online constantly.

The other big difference is that Freenet has the "darknet" or Friend to
Friend mode, where your Freenet node (software on your computer) only
connects to the Freenet nodes run by your friends, i.e. people you know (and
maybe to their friends, to speed things up). This makes blocking Freenet,
e.g. on a national firewall, extremely difficult.
""") + "\n\n" + _("""
However, most people currently use Freenet in "opennet" mode (that is,
connecting automatically to whoever the network assigns, rather than
connecting only to their friends). This is much less secure than using
Freenet in "darknet" mode, and is relatively easy to block, as it does have
some central servers ("seed nodes").

Freenet has many unsolved problems, and is still experimental. Our objective
for Freenet is to build a global friend-to-friend darknet, which would be
extremely difficult to block, and would provide very strong anonymity and
censorship resistance. This will require further work on Freenet,
on usability, speed and security, but above all it is a techno-social
experiment: Will people know enough friends who are willing to use Freenet to
make such an anonymous friend-to-friend network possible? This is why Freenet
supports "opennet" mode: to let people try it out before they ask their
friends to connect.

Tor is a little less experimental, and arguably is an easier problem; it may
provide better anonymity today, provided that it isn't blocked, and of
course, Tor lets you access the internet as a whole, whereas on Freenet you
can only access Freenet content. However if you can use a large enough
darknet, Freenet already provides an interesting level of censorship
resistance, DoS resistance and anonymity.
""") + "\n\n" + _("""
Using the internet "anonymously" is not necessarily easy: Connecting to
Facebook through Tor doesn't prevent Facebook from knowing pretty much
everything about you, and connecting to your (non-HTTPS) webmail account
through Tor may mean the person running the proxy ("exit node") can steal
your webmail account password.

Freenet is a separate network, which does things differently, because there
are no central servers. This is why we don't support Javascript, server-side
scripting etc on freesites: Everything must be rewritten to work on a
distributed network. But the advantage is there is no single server which can
be compelled to hand over your private communications or which can be shut
down.

There are still risks, for example, talking about your home town or internet
provider on an anonymous forum, or downloading files which Freenet can't make
safe such as PDFs or word processor documents (Freenet will warn you about
this). Also, for web content in particular, it may be easier to upload it to
Freenet than set up a hidden server on Tor; you don't need to keep your node
online for your content to be available, you don't need to figure out how to
configure it safely, and most important, if you go away your site will still
be available.

### Summary:

Tor (or I2P):

* Lets you access the Internet (but be careful!).
* Lets you access anonymous web servers and other services.
* Lets you host anonymous web servers, which need to be kept online, and can be
  DoS'ed, but can run any dynamic or server-side content you want.
* Provides reasonable anonymity
* Has been blocked by several countries, with varying success. Even its hidden
  bridges can be harvested and blocked with moderate effort.
* Is somewhat centralised
* Is more mature and has more users and developers

Freenet in general:

* Only lets you access content uploaded to Freenet, including (static) websites,
  email, filesharing, forums, microblogging, etc. All of which are anonymous
  (or pseudonymous i.e. you create an untraceable identity).
* Hosts content in a distributed way: You don't know what your node is storing,
  any given content is distributed across many nodes.
* Ensures that popular content will be available forever.
* Is older than Tor, but more experimental (arguably it's a harder task).

Freenet in darknet mode: (friend to friend: connects only to your friends' nodes)

Half the hidden services on Tor were using a single hosting service,
whose owner has now been arrested. While we don't approve of these sites,
it does illustrate the point: A centralised network is a vulnerable network.
Unfortunately, decentralised networks are hard, but in the long run they are
more secure.

wide-ranging effects, including on Freenet, should it pass, and similar laws
such as IPRED2 have been tried in the past. There have also been attempts to
force peer to peer systems to provide wiretapping capabilities in the USA,
and there are [worrying developments](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19968068)
in the UK that might result in it being blocked, but not being made illegal
per se. As far as we know none of these things - apart from the first two -
have passed. Many of these are arguable either way (depending on how broadly
the legislation is applied) and will have to be decided in caselaw. The law
can be an ass sometimes. You can read the EFF's (US-centric) advice to peer

Freenet works fine in France and we have many French users!).

Technically, Freenet 0.7 has some minimal defences against blocking; the
protocol is relatively hard to identify (we are working on ["transport

[make it much harder to detect Freenet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography).
Freenet supports a [darknet](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Darknet) mode (i.e.
only connecting to your friends) which makes automated harvesting and
blocking of nodes very difficult. Note that many mobile internet providers
block all peer to peer networks along with other content, and many corporate

government came to us and demanded a back door, we would be legally unable to

**Short answer:** Probably, on opennet. Maybe, on darknet.

**Long answer:**

Freenet has a different threat model to Tor and the Mixmaster remailers.
Freenet is designed to resist censorship: The network must therefore be
robust, and content must be distributed without requiring a central server,
whether anonymous or not. Anonymity is important for requesters and
especially for those who upload content in the first place. The typical
example is a corporate or government whistleblower. Generally to find the
originator of some content, the attacker must be able to predict the data in
advance, must be able to move across the network relatively quickly, and must
be able to perform the attack while the data is being inserted; after that,
it is distributed across the network and is much harder to trace, and the
originator may have left the network. However, if by chance or by
overwhelming force the attacker is connected to the whistleblower (or e.g.
seizes the computers of everyone on the network), he may be able to identify
this much more quickly. All of this is vastly more difficult on a darknet,
where everyone connects only to their friends, where it is very hard for an
attacker to find nodes, and where to connect to a given node he must social
engineer its operator! Freenet does support opennet mode (plug and play),
but darknet is far more secure, and far more difficult to block on a national
firewall.

Tor on the other hand is designed to anonymise real-time data streams,
on the assumption that the list of nodes can be public, that there is a free
world where nodes can be operated safely, that the authors of controversial
content will be able to either host (hidden) web servers themselves or upload
it to other (hidden, but usually centralised) storage systems, and so on. And
Tor has a concept of a "client", which is somebody who uses the service
without providing any value to it; on Freenet, every node relays data for its
neighbours. Hence the attacks on Freenet are completely different to the
attacks on Tor. Both compromise to some degree to enable more or less
real-time performance.
""") + "\n\n" + _("""
If you can use the darknet, trust your friends, don't reinsert files, always
use the "Insert a random, safe key" option, and change your anonymous
identity after some volume of inserts, you should be relatively safe using
Freenet. However this has not yet been quantified. If you can connect,
build up some trust in your anonymous persona, insert your controversial
content, and then disappear, again, you are better off with Freenet,
especially if the content is a website (but if you are connecting on opennet,
beware of seednode compromises). In some other cases, Tor is better.

We are still working on Freenet's security and there are major security
enhancements which have not yet been implemented, most of which will go in
before 1.0\. Cryptographic tunnels similar to Tor's onion routing are one
possibility, which would greatly reduce the impact of many of the below
attacks, but there are several other enhancements planned, both to anonymity
and to network robustness/undetectability.
""") + "\n\n" + _("""
**Major known attacks:**  

In the interests of giving would-be users as much information as possible,
and on the assumption that any serious attacker would do their homework,
here are the major classes of attack on Freenet we are presently aware of:
""") + "\n\n" + _("""
* **Harvesting**: Simply by running some powerful Freenet nodes, an attacker can
  identify most of the opennet (Strangers network) relatively easily. These
  nodes can then be attacked one by one (subject to resources), their traffic
  analysed, or simply be blocked on a national firewall. Connecting only to
  friends (darknet) largely solves this problem. ISPs may be able to identify
  Freenet nodes with some effort, although we make this fairly difficult:
  Freenet's current protocol is designed to be hard to detect, and steganography
  will be introduced at some point. However, traffic flow analysis, or
  brute-force blocking of all peer to peer traffic (e.g. traffic between IP
  addresses marked as "consumer" rather than "business"), both of which would
  hit a lot of things other than Freenet, would likely be effective for quite
  some time.
""") + "\n" + _("""
* **Bootstrapping attacks**: Unless a node only connects to friends, it will
  have to connect to the opennet "seednodes" to announce itself and get
  initial peers to connect to. At the moment there are relatively few
  seednodes and the list is maintained manually. The seednodes could be blocked
  easily by a national firewall etc, but also, there is little to prevent
  attackers from setting up their own seednodes and submitting them, and then
  "capturing" any new Freenet users who connect to their nodes, in order to
  observe their traffic etc. Freenet will try to announce to multiple seednodes,
  but see the below section on "correlation attacks", which generally are
  feasible with only a single connection to the target. So this is a question of
  resources - if the attacker has the resources to surveil all new Freenet
  nodes, he has a good chance of pulling it off. In future we may have more
  seednodes, and only reveal a small proportion of them to each node, as Tor
  does with its hidden bridges, but that will not prevent attackers from
  creating lots of malicious seednodes and getting them into the official lists,
  and it will likely still be possible to block all the seednodes with some
  effort (something similar has already happened to Tor hidden bridges in
  China). Combined with harvesting and adaptive search attacks, this attack
  explains why opennet is regarded by many core developers as hopelessly
  insecure. If you want good security you need to connect only to friends. Hit
  and run inserts are possible, and can be relatively safe in terms of many of
  the other attacks, but you are taking the risk that the opennet seednode you
  connect to may be malicious.
""") + "\n" + _("""
* **Correlation attacks**: If you are connected to a node, and can recognise the
  keys being requested (probably because it was posted publicly), you can show
  statistically that the node in question probably requested it, based on the
  proportion of the keys requested from that node, the locations of nearby
  nodes, the HTL on the requests and so on. This will be largely eliminated
  by tunnels (but these will be quite expensive so may need to be turned off
  by default except for predictable blocks), but in any case it requires a
  rather powerful attacker compared to the next attack... Note also that if you
  only connect to your friends, a remote attacker will have to either co-opt
  your friends or social engineer you into giving them a connection; either way,
  connecting to the entire network this way is rather expensive: If they already
  suspect you personally they'll probably bug your keyboard rather than trying
  to connect to your Freenet node!
""") + "\n" + _("""
* **Adaptive search**: If you want to find the author of some content, and you
  can predict the exact keys which will be inserted, and you are able to
  connect to new nodes at will, you may be able to listen out for the keys,
  guess where they must have come from, connect to nodes near there, and if your
  guess is correct, get more keys which gives you a more accurate fix on the
  originator, so the attack gets faster and faster and eventually converges on
  the originator. This attack is most powerful with inserts of big, predictable
  files, but the "Insert a random, safe key" option will make the keys
  unpredictable even if the content is guessable, by using random encryption
  keys. The downside is it produces a different key each time for the same file,
  and you can never safely reinsert the same file to the same key. Given that
  Freenet's data persistence is currently relatively poor, this is a problem.
  Anyway, if you _can_ use the random keys option, the attacker is unable to
  move towards you until after you announce the file: Most of his samples will
  come not from the actual content inserts but from chat posts. There are far
  fewer of these, and changing your pseudonymous identity periodically will
  help, provided the attacker cannot easily connect the new identity to the old
  one. Using a dedicated identity for posting sensitive content, which doesn't
  chat too much, again will help. Another thing which makes a huge difference is
  connecting only to your friends (i.e. using darknet): This makes it extremely
  difficult for an attacker to get new connections closer to where he thinks you
  must be, just as it helps with correlation attacks. So the biggest problems
  with this attack are 1) Files which are not very popular fall off Freenet
  relatively quickly, so need to be reinserted, but it is not safe to reinsert
  to the same key (this is why we have the "Insert a canonical key" option, for
  those who don't care about attacks), and 2) Chat can still be attacked.
  Tunnels will help to deal with both problems, and by default will only be used
  for predictable keys so can be relatively slow without this causing problems
  in practice. Also there is work going on on various techniques to allow users
  to do reinserts safely via for example preventing the attacker from seeing
  requests started before he connected. Another important point is this only
  works if the source is uploading new content, or chatting, regularly; creating
  and bootstrapping a new pseudonymous identity over a short period, doing a
  single insert (of any size) with the safe random key option, and announcing
  it, should be relatively safe from this attack, even on opennet - but see the
  section above on bootstrapping attacks.
""") + "\n" + _("""
* **Traffic analysis**: Freenet provides minimal protection against global
  traffic analysis (basic message padding etc); if the attacker also has
  nodes on the network, the extra data will likely be helpful. We certainly do
  not guarantee that it is impossible to trace data transfers from one node to
  the next with detailed traffic data, however it is hoped that this will fall
  down on the busier nodes. One day we will implement steganographic transports
  and/or constant bitrate links as an option for more paranoid users. Note that
  on Tor-style networks, global traffic analysis will defeat the network
  completely: all that is needed is to observe both the entry and exit points.
""") + "\n" + _("""
* **Swapping attacks**: It is possible to attack the location swapping
  algorithm, and thereby disrupt routing on friend-to-friend networks. This has
  been demonstrated by the authors of the Pitch Black paper. We are working on a
  solution, but sadly at the moment most users use opennet.

Short answer: no.

Long answer:

We don't think so. Aside from protecting freedom of speech, Freenet is also
designed to be an efficient dynamic caching system. If information is
requested a lot from a limited number of nodes, the nodes that the requests
pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. If
information is inserted on a limited set of nodes and then subsequently
requested a lot from a separate set of nodes, with repetition, the sets will
close in on one another in the network topology until they are "neighbors"
and only the originally targeted nodes are suffering from the attack.

In other words, in order to harm Freenet with a flood you need to
consistently change your point of entry into the network and continually
insert and request new data, and you will still only increase the workload
for the network that is linear to your own. Given an immense will and
capacity greater than the total of the entire network, it is possible to
cripple any public network (including the Internet itself) with floods,
but it is our intention to always keep Freenet as resistant to this as
theoretically possible.

Curiously enough, the above analysis only applies to [Opennet](
https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Opennet). On Darknet, you might have a little
more success, although it would be much harder to change your entry point in
any significant way. Nonetheless, you have a reasonably low bandwidth
multiplier (the total number of nodes visited, around 20 on average), and you
are severely limited by the number of nodes you can connect to, which will be
low on a darknet.

Hashing the key and encrypting the data is not meant a method to keep Freenet
Node operators from being able to figure out what type of information is in
their nodes if they really want to (after all, they can just find the key in

keep operators from having to know what information is in their nodes if they
don't want to. This distinction is more a legal one than a technical one. It
is not realistic to expect a node operator to try to continually collect and/
or guess possible keys and then check them against the information in his
node (even if such an attack is viable from a security perspective),
so a sane society is less likely to hold an operator liable for such
information on the network.

The existence of malicious nodes within the network is the most difficult
problem that a distributed network must face, and has been the bane of many
previous ideas. Many systems (such as multiplayer gaming networks) try to
avoid malicious nodes by keeping the protocol and code closed, but we have
yet to see an example of that working in the long run. And anyway it is
opposed to Freenet's philosophy.

Freenet is based on a balance of positive and negative feedback loops that
bring requests for information to a node when it is functioning well,
and keep requests away from it when it is not. The key to avoiding "cancers"
is (as in the body) to make sure these loops can correctly identify even the
most carefully designed malicious node and not keep sending requests to it.
This issue is not fully dealt with by the current test code, but you can rest
assured that a number of possible solutions have been on the table and
discussed for some time now. Several have been implemented (enforcing hashes

that causes timeouts ...)

First of all, we **strongly** suggest that you install Freenet inside an
encrypted drive using, for example, [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/).
It is not possible for Freenet to prevent all leaks of private data,
especially if you download media files etc. Even if you only browse freesites
and use the chat plugins, there will still be potentially incriminating data
in your swapfile, which needs to be encrypted (on recent versions of Windows
you could try the command "fsutil behavior set encryptpagingfile 1",
but really the solution is to encrypt your whole system including swap). It
is also essential that you use your web browser in privacy mode, or with
cache and history turned off; we try to do this if you launch Freenet via the
rabbit icon, but there are no guarantees as unfortunately this functionality
seems buggy in current web browsers. Browser plugins could also be a problem,
and you should use a separate browser for Freenet if in any doubt. Be careful
with the files you download from Freenet - not only could anyone seizing your
computer see you have them (media files are likely to be written to disk even
if you open them directly in your web browser and never save them), but also
they could contain threats to anonymity themselves, such as calling back to a
malicious website etc; this is possible in for instance PDFs and some video
formats. Freenet tries to warn you about this when it can't filter out such
malicious content: Currently it can only filter HTML pages, GIF/PNG/JPEG
images and CSS, and MP3s, but we will add support for Ogg soon and other
formats later. And of course there are many other threats - you should take
standard security precautions, such as not running operating systems that are
no longer updated, not running software not from a trustworthy source,
using appropriate security software etc (if you have a firewall make sure it
allows the two UDP ports Freenet needs through).

Because not all users will have installed encrypted drives at the time when
they first install Freenet, Freenet itself attempts to encrypt all the
potentially incriminating data that it stores on disk. Details are below but
as explained, leaks are inevitable: you really should [encrypt your disks!](

The main datastore does not store data you request or insert (or that is

nodes: This was introduced to fix [this attack](
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/13/freener_not_so_anonymous/) publicised
by The Register. Freenet has a separate client-cache, which stores data which
you have recently requested to avoid having to go back to the network every
time (which would not only reduce speed but also security, by giving
attackers more opportunities to see your requests). Also, Freenet stores the
list of your downloads and uploads (which you can see on the Filesharing
menu), their current progress, and various other data, in the file node.db4o
(or node.db4o.crypt). The actual data is kept in the persistent-temp-*
directory. Unless you set the physical security level to LOW, this data is
encrypted. At MAXIMUM, the encryption keys are never written to disk, so the
data is effectively wiped on restarting the node; otherwise the encryption
keys are stored in a file called master.keys (on HIGH this is passworded).
You can wipe the data by either using the panic button on the
downloads/uploads page or by securely deleting master.keys. Freenet also
creates temporary files for other requests, which are also encrypted unless
physical seclevel is LOW, which are in temp-*. Also, some plugins may create
their own data files, which may contain for instance messages you have posted
or downloaded from chat forums, and currently bookmarks and recently
completed files are stored in plain text. It is our intention to move these

have automatic backups for node.db4o. See [here](

### The lists

* [Announcements](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/announce/) ([archive](https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/announce/))<br/>
  Please sign up here to be notified of major Freenet developments, such as
  announcements of new releases or important bugfixes. This list is moderated
  and is very low traffic (less than one message per month).
* [Support](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/support/) ([archive](https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/support/))<br/>
  Asking for or giving advice relating to getting Freenet working,
  bug reports, and suggestions on improving the user experience. Requests for
  help are more likely to be heard here than in the other mailing lists.
  **Note:** Emails sent to this mailing list from those not subscribed to the
  list must be manually approved, and this can impose a delay of several days.
  To avoid this delay, please [subscribe](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/support/).
* [Tech](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tech/) ([archive](https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/tech/))<br/>
  This is for general technical discussion of Freenet. If you want to discuss
  longer-term technical ideas about Freenet, please use this list.
* [Development](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devl/) ([archive](https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/))<br/>
  This list is for active developers to discuss bugs, and the implementation
  of near-term new features. Please only post to this list if you know what you
  are talking about, otherwise use the tech mailing list (see above).
* [Darknet-Tools](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/darknet-tools/) ([archive](https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/darknet-tools/))<br/>
  A mailing list to discuss and develop ways of extending the darknet while
  keeping it a darknet: Instant messenger plugins, IRC plugins, email
  invitations, functionality in the node needed to support these, and any other
  means of extending the darknet while keeping it a darknet as much as possible.
* [Chat](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/chat/) ([archive](https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/chat/))<br/>
  This list is for general discussion of Freenet, topics that are not
  suitable to other lists. Discussions of politics, law, philosophy, lawsuits,
  programming languages, related technology that should not be part of Freenet,
  and any thread that the developers and users don't deem appropriate to the
  main lists should be discussed here. Questions such as "How can I prevent my
  node from being used by terrorists?", or "Why don't you rewrite Freenet in
  C++?" should be addressed to this list.

here is the [full list](https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/)._

Many of the developers and users of Freenet can often be found on an [IRC](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) channel, #freenet on chat.freenode.net.
Almost everyone on the channel is a volunteer, and may be busy with other
things, so you may not get an instant answer: **Ask your question/say what
the problem is, then wait for a few minutes, and somebody may help you**.

[Chat with us](https://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=freenet)

If you do not get an answer within the first few minutes, please keep the
chat window open. We read our backlog, and if you stay, you will normally get
an answer **within at most 4 hours** (when people with the relevant knowledge
wake up).
