Freenet / Hyphanet 0.7.5 build 1500 is now available.

> **Install Freenet / Hyphanet** for **[Windows][windows-installer]**, for **[GNU/Linux, macOS and other *nixes][linux-installer]**, or for **[Android][android-package]**. See the [download page][download page] for more information and other platforms (Apple Silicon needs library updates to work).

This release fixes regressions that slipped into Hyphanet 1499:

<div style="float: right; width: 30%; max-width: 300px;"><img src="./theme/images/logo-large.png" width="100%" style="filter: invert(30%)"  /></div>

- an endless loop on hostname resolution on friend-to-friend nodes with all peers connected leading to very high CPU usage — thanks to bertm for the review!
- typo in text-decoration filter — thanks to Torusrxxx for the fix!
- NullPointerException when disabling and reenabling SSL — thanks to Torusrxxx for the Fix!


Also it adds two small improvements


- In the first time wizard the save button is now named "Finish" to make it clear that the node starts after clicking it
- update Japanese translation — thanks to qupo1

Thank you for using Hyphanet!

## What is Freenet / Hyphanet?

Hyphanet is the original Freenet,  
a peer-to-peer platform for  
censorship-resistant and privacy-respecting  
publishing and communication.

That Hyphanet can keep moving forward and help people worldwide to
exercise their basic rights and freedoms is the work of amazing
volunteers, both contributors and people running Hyphanet nodes.
