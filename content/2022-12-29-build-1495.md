This build improves four broad areas:

<div style="float: right; width: 30%; max-width: 300px;"><img src="./theme/images/logo-large.png" width="100%" style="filter: invert(30%)"  /></div>

- new users
- user experience
- performance
- backend changes

<div style="clear: both"></div>

New users
---------

There is a new firsttime wizard for single-step setup, contributed
by redwerk and finally merged after resolving dependency-requirements.

To further ease the start, the bookmarks are re-organized with
"starting points" at the top.


User experience
---------------

For integration in browser extensions,  TheSeeker added support for
the schemes web+freenet and ext+freenet which do not need further
allow-listing by browsers to use.

CometZ@6DtYG~ created a new theme sky-dark-static, a clean dark scheme,
simpler than Winterfacey.

To enable more beautiful Freesites, Spider Admin, naejadu and vwoodzell
extended the CSS filter to enable sticky, transition, and word-wrap.

The m3u-player is now only inserted into sites which contain at least
one video or audio tag. When a part of a stream fails, it is now skipped,
allowing for continuous playback without user-intervention.


Performance
-----------

For better lifetime of larger files, the healing size is increased
from 16 to 256 MiB, so a 512 MiB file will keep working if accessed
once every 10 days. To keep alive files explicitly, you can use the
keepalive plugin. You can activate it from the menu via
Configuration / Plugins.

And the pending keys optimizations by Eleriseth should reduce the CPU
load on very fast nodes with many peers.


Backend Changes
---------------

- merged the HashingAPI by unixninja92, a GSoC project that had
  gotten lost in the pull requests. This provides an easy and
  well-tested way to create and verify different types of Hashes from byte
  arrays, including Sha256 and TigerTree.

- merged announcement fixes by toad
- upgraded unit tests to junit4, thanks to vwoodzell!
- fixed the client getter method to honor the max size argument


A big thank you to all contributors and reviewers

## What is Freenet?

Freenet is a peer-to-peer platform for  
censorship-resistant and privacy-respecting  
publishing and communication.

That Freenet can keep moving forward and help people worldwide to
exercise their basic rights and freedoms is the work of amazing
volunteers, both contributors and people running Freenet nodes.
