## Pitch Black Mitigation

For the last decade Freenet has been vulnerable to [the pitch black attack](https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=3919)
that could disrupt its high-security friend-to-friend mode.

With this release, **the pitch black attack is mitigated**.

If you decided not to use Freenet in the past because you knew about
the pitch black attack, now is a great time to give Freenet another try!

This finalizes the mitigation [with a test](https://github.com/hyphanet/fred/pull/736)
that shows that it is effective at reducing the impact of the attack
and recovering from it:

*What is the pitch black attack?*

On Freenet, every node has a location on a circle.

To optimize routing, pure friend-to-friend nodes (no opennet)
swap these locations without changing actual connections.
The pitch black attack steals the locations one by one
and replaces them with a single one,
so that after a while all nodes are at the same location.

Then no sensible routing is possible anymore.

The mitigation detects when parts of the circle are devoid of routing
nodes and fills up the holes by switching there. Then regular swapping
brings them back to an optimized position.

*This mitigation was [sponsored](https://nlnet.nl/project/Freenet-Routing/)
by nlnet as part of the Horizon 2020 program of the EU.*

## Video-on-Demand

The video-player now prevents most visual flickering and makes
video-on-demand over Freenet a good match for conference-talks like
those from 36c3:

The [guile media site](https://hg.sr.ht/~arnebab/guile-media-site)
repository provides a tool to create your own streaming site that is
hosted decentrally and with good privacy protections within Freenet.

While publishing this is not as simple as uploading a video to a
streaming site, for the visitors of your site it is convenient and safe.

No ads, no trackers, but good moderation tools without centralized
control. As a happy user put it:

*“That’s Freenet. It’s the internet that should have been”* — Red, 2021

## Diagnostics

To help performance analysis, there is now a diagnostics component
with thread runtime information. You can activate it in the advanced
core settings of your node. This should make it easier to identify
performance bottlenecks.

Thanks to DC*!

## Plugin-Updates

- KeyUtils got bugfixes from TheSeeker
- Library now searches all indexes if you just hit search — thanks to redwerk.
- Library now also allows setting a custom link suffic (docname) — thanks to TheSeeker.
- Spider got bugfixes from redwerk and juiceman.
- FlogHelper provides simple clickable audio and video tags.
  Just put a m3u link into the video tag to have video-on-demand.

## Bugfixes

- skip in support.io.SkipShieldingInputStream must return
  non-negative. Thanks to dennisnez.
- NodeConfig was reading a particular config from default on every
  start up. Thanks to desyncr.
- OpenJDK 16+ compat: add wrapper.conf argument to allow access to
  internal openjdk modules.
- Correct "current size" option in Wizard => datastore size.
  Thanks to AC4BB21B.

## What is Freenet?

> Freenet is a peer-to-peer platform for  
> censorship-resistant and privacy-respecting  
> publishing and communication.

and

> Freenet is a communication system that covers the needs for protection  
> expected from a secure data broker for Multi-Party Data Exchange in IoT for Health.  
> ([source](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/using-freenet-as-a-broker-for-multi-party-data-exchange-in-iot-for-health/257911))

This is what Freenet already accomplished.

And we could only get this far together, Freenet developers and
Freenet users who fight to further the open and democratic
distribution of information, because without users, it is hard for
software to make a difference.

Thank you for using Freenet!
