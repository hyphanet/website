This is a smaller release that provides three improvements and fixes
one regression:

<div style="float: right; width: 30%; max-width: 300px;"><img src="./theme/images/logo-large.png" width="100%" style="filter: invert(30%)"  /></div>

- fix keepalive
- update translations
- new freemail info page
- installer, test and charset fixes

<div style="clear: both"></div>

Fix keepalive
-------------

This fixes breakage in keepalive by ignoring a negative maxsize.
This was broken by a fix to the client
to actually honor the maxsize which was ignored before,
so ignoring invalid values provides a compatibility layer
for old plugins.


Update translations
-------------------

Imported updated translations from transifex.

The biggest changes were done by the Russian team,
adding or updating almost 200 translations.

The German team changed over 70 translations.

And 1 to 7 changes were done by teams
es, fa, fi, fr, hu, it, ja, nb-no,
nl, pt (br and PT), sv, zh-cn and zh-tw.

A big thank you for your work!


Bookmark curation
-----------------

The update replaces the unmaintained freemail site in the default bookmarks
by a maintained one — thanks to Cynthia!


Further changes
---------------

- add meta charset tests
- add missing test annotations — thanks to vwoodzell!
- when using the windows installer to update, wrapper.conf will be overwritten
  to make it work with changed dependencies. Thanks to naejadu!
- support <meta charset="utf-8"> in the header of freesites to set the encoding


A big thank you to all contributors and reviewers
for getting this release in shape!

And thank you for using Freenet!


Remaining known bug
-------------------

There is one known problem with the installer that can cause Freenet
to stay in friend-to-friend mode (not connecting) even when you do not
check that you know people using Freenet. If that should happen to you
and you want to connect to strangers, please check in the menu
configuration - security levels and set the protection against
strangers to normal.

This should get fixed in 1497.
