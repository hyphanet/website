The [Freenet installer][downloads_url] for OS X is now a native application. It should fix several major installation problems OS X users have encountered in the past.

It also includes an updated [tray application][tray_url] with bugfixes and new features.

All Freenet users on OS X are encouraged to [download][tray_release_url] the new tray application.
