Freenet 0.7.5 build 1497 is now available.

> **Install Freenet** for **[Windows][windows-installer]**, for **[GNU/Linux, macOS and other *nixes][linux-installer]**, or for **[Android][android-package]**. See the [download page][download page] for more information and other platforms.

This release fixes a severe vulnerability in path folding that allowed
to distinguish between downloaders and forwarders with an adapted
node that is directly connected via opennet.

This vulnerability was reported to the Project by Prof. Ming Yang and
Prof. Zhen Ling from the School of Computer Science and Engineering,
Southeast University, Prof. Xinwen Fu from the Miner School of
Computer & Information Sciences, University of Massachusetts Lowell,
and Yonghuan Xu from School of Cyber Science and Engineering,
Southeast university.

Yonghuan also provided support in fixing the vulnerability. Thank you
very much!

To reduce the probability of hitting other problems in path folding,
we also merged the pull-request to completely avoid path folding at
HTL 17 or higher.
