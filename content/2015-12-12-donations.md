Freenet is a platform for censorship-resistant communication and publishing. For the past 15 years the project has built tools to fight for freedom of speech and information.
Our software provides a decentralized peer-to-peer network designed to hide who publishes or accesses potentially controversial information - or even that it exists - especially useful for those living in oppressive political regimes.

While development is primarily driven by volunteers, the project has also employed paid developers to provide more-focused work.
Over the past 2 years, the project's paid developer has made [great progress][build18] improving “Web of Trust” functionality to combat spam, which is a central problem in any anonymous system.
Unfortunately, the Freenet Project no longer has enough money to retain his services, so he is now a volunteer.
This greatly reduces his capacity to continue this important work.

We are extremely excited for the future of Freenet and the [projects built on top of it][projects].
There is so much more work to do, and full-time developers greatly benefit the project.

Help us keep Internet freedom alive and expand human liberty.
