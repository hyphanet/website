Freenet 0.7.5 build 1489 codename “solstice” is now available.


> **[Download Freenet][download page]**


This release adds an m3u-filter that enables safe access to m3u-playlists.
Together with the existing support for media files (Audio using mp3,
Ogg Vorbis, or Flac, and video using Ogg Theora), safe playlists make
Freenet viable as **streaming platform**: You can create an m3u-file
and others can play it right from their media-players (i.e. mpv or
vlc). If you want to stream via Freenet yourself, you’ll find help in
a [thirdparty howto][streaming-howto].

To try an example stream on GNU/Linux with a default Freenet install, just call

    mpv --ytdl=no --prefetch-playlist http://127.0.0.1:8888/freenet:SSK@d8lB5dqTaAt~39aFk6KyMU4cb5y3BEkNWgneouaVq0g,P~pzGxzDr08D7NfzKkKOvRHGf3jXUAr7lavnZfszflc,AQACAAE/stream.m3u

Test-stream under cc-licenses thanks to [theradio.cc][]. Let the sun return (or the nights grow longer again, depending on where you live) with **radio over Freenet**!


On the network layer this release adopts
the one safe change from the let-it-burn patchset: 
Maximum backoff-times are reduced from 3 hours to 8 minutes.
This might increase bandwidth available.
Also progresspage.js now has a declared license for [Libre-JS][].


For additional details see the [release tag for 1489][releasetag1489].
You can download this release as usual from the [download page][],
or if you are already using Freenet, simply let your freenet node
update itself over Freenet.

We hope you enjoy using Freenet!
