title:  Freenet / Hyphanet build 1503: fix vulnerability and visibility, add animated webp, convenience, and optimization
date:   2025-02-22
categories: release
---
Freenet / Hyphanet 0.7.5 build 1503 is now available.

> **Install Freenet / Hyphanet** for **[Windows][windows-installer]**, for **[GNU/Linux, macOS and other *nixes][linux-installer]**, or for **[Android][android-package]**. See the [download page][download page] for more information and other platforms (Apple Silicon needs library updates to work).

This is a shared release page for 1502 and 1503. 1502 fixed an
inserter tracing vulnerability and added several features while 1503
is a hotfix release that fixes regressions in 1502. The main changes are:

<div style="float: right; width: 30%; max-width: 300px;"><img src="./theme/images/logo-large.png" width="100%" style="filter: invert(30%)"  /></div>

- fixed vulnerability and reduce visibility on the network
- support animated webp and more modern HTML and CSS
- enable direct linking to Freemail
- dismiss alerts and convenience
- substantial routing optimizations
- fixes

## vulnerability and visibility

The most important change is a fix to a vulnerability that enabled
attackers to differentiate between an uploading and a forwarding node
by analyzing the structure of packets in blocks. It was reported
responsibly by *Yonghuan Xu* and depended on block-level timing of
packet handling.

Thank you very much for reporting the vulnerability and creating and
testing a mitigation!

1503 fixed a thread leak from our adaption of the vulnerability
mitigation that caused very fast nodes to restart within a few days,
because the number of waiting threads exceeded the thread limit.
Thanks to bertm for finding a minimally invasive solution and max_iops
for reporting the problem and testing fixes!

There were some additional privacy and safety improvements: do not
check reachability of global addresses to avoid a fallback to Echo
packets when a node does not support Ping, don‚Äôt show download to disk
for large file page on public gateway nodes, and make fproxy cross
origin isolated -- the latter by torusrxxx.

## animated webp and more HTML/CSS

There is now support for animated, lossy webp images, recovering
some capabilities we lost when browsers removed support for the Theora
codec, and for WAV files for lossless audio. Thank you to Torusrxxx!

Torusrxxx also increased again the fraction of HTML and CSS elements
that can be used on Freesites. More and more pages should just work.
Freesites can now set robots, googlebot and referrer=no-referrer, for
example for the Spiders that update indizes, as well as use more CSS
properties.

1503 fixed a problem displaying Freesites that include an input tag
without type. Sites with such an incomplete input tag can now be
visited again. Thanks to torusrxxx!

## link to freemail

Also Freemail now allows inbound links with to=WOT_ID, so you can use  
links on Freesites that directly open in Freemail.

## dismiss alerts and convenience

On the alerts page there are buttons to dismiss all alerts that do not
come from other nodes, or to delete all messages from other nodes.
This should unclutter alerts and make node-to-node messages much more
usable.


## optimization

There are new optimizations to the code -- a lot of them
improvements to synchronization -- which should reduce CPU load of
nodes with many peers and make it easier to run simple routing nodes
(without messaging) on weak, cheap, energy conserving hardware:

- Fix synchronization of receive buffer -- #1044 by ArneBab. Thanks to
  Yonguan Xu for the catch!
- Do not synchronize on global variable in CryptoKey.fingerprint --
  #1066 by bertm
- Do not synchronize on access to AEADCryptBucket.readOnly -- #1065 by
  bertm
- Do not synchronize on global variable in crypt Util.makeKey -- #1064
  by bertm
- Do not synchronize on Rijndael cipher initialization or use -- #1061
  by bertm
- Use length hint for bucket creation in ChecksumChecker -- #1059 by
  bertm
- Optimize OCBBlockCipher_v149 by replacing Vector with List -- #1057
  by bertm
- Use JCE AES implementation for AEAD when available -- #1056 by bertm


## fixes

Additionally there are visible Fixes:

- Update dependencies.properties wrapper files to files in
  java_installer to avoid downgrading the wrapper after the first
  start -- #1081 by ArneBab
- Fix regression: compress parameter was inverted on upload. Thanks to
  NewOne@umLZL for investigating! -- #1051 by ArneBab
- Build the Atom XML correctly -- #1080 by Bombe
- Do not fix case (upper/lower) of header key -- #1063 by torusrxxx
- Fix request distribution stats -- #1071 by bertm
- In the plugins visibility was adjusted to show in simple mode the
  plugins that actually are easy to understand for newcomers.
- Below the shutdown-button, there‚Äôs now an info how to disable
  autostart in GNU Linux.
- And 1503 added two new seednodes to speed up inital connection in
  Opennet. Thank you for providing them!

And internal code fixes:

- Return valid length from RandomShortReadInputStream.read -- #1060 by
  bertm
- Fix single-byte read() in various InputStream implementations --
  #1058 by bertm

And improvements to  the code to ease maintenance:

- üêõ Allow Class Loader to Enumerate Directory Entries. Fixes Flyway
  usage -- #1049 by Bombe
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Use accessor for NodeClientCore.mainExecutor -- #1079 by Bombe
- Add Accessors for PageNode‚Äôs Member Fields -- #1076 by Bombe
- Add Accessors for Two Member Fields Used in PeerNodeStatus -- #1075 by Bombe
- Fix Translation Handling in Tests -- #1074 by Bombe
- Remove main(...) methods and related test/debug routines -- #1070 by
  bertm
- Remove unused code and parameters from NodeStats -- #1069 by bertm
- Remove remaining code paths for disabled slow-down sending -- #1068
  by bertm
- Get rid of Hashtable in NodeStats -- #1067 by bertm
- Fix the test for UserAlertManager where localization didn‚Äôt work correctly. 
  Thanks to Bombe!

## What is Freenet / Hyphanet?

Hyphanet is the original Freenet,  
a peer-to-peer platform for  
censorship-resistant and privacy-respecting  
publishing and communication.

That Hyphanet can keep moving forward and help people worldwide to
exercise their basic rights and freedoms is the work of amazing
volunteers, both contributors and people running Hyphanet nodes.

Thank you for your contributions, and thank you for using Freenet / Hyphanet!
