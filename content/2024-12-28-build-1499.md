Freenet / Hyphanet 0.7.5 build 1499 is now available.

> **Install Freenet / Hyphanet** for **[Windows][windows-installer]**, for **[GNU/Linux, macOS and other *nixes][linux-installer]**, or for **[Android][android-package]**. See the [download page][download page] for more information and other platforms (Apple Silicon needs library updates to work).

This release adds cleanups and optimizations on the way to Freenet /
Hyphanet 0.8. It improves privacy with DNS requests, optimizes the
networking and data transfer core and provides many improvements for
website authors and user experience.

There are five larger areas of improvements:

<div style="float: right; width: 30%; max-width: 300px;"><img src="./theme/images/logo-large.png" width="100%" style="filter: invert(30%)"  /></div>

- improved privacy protection
- optimized networking layer
- support for website authors
- better user experience
- clean ups and code purges

<div style="clear: both"></div>


## Privacy

The privacy improvements are reduced pings and DNS lookups. These make
it less likely that a node gets detected by pings it sends for other
nodes that use DNS addresses to have permanent addresses. Also thanks
to Torusrxxx SSL support is updated and when setting up a node for
access via SSL, unencrypted HTTP links now get upgraded to secured
HTTPS automatically.

## Networking

The networking layer got a fix for very fast nodes. On these the bulk
queue could be starved when realtime requests were received faster
than they could be completed. Also bertm fixed bulk backoff getting
ignored.

Juiceman removed unnecessary boxing and unboxing to reduce CPU load
and Torusrxxx improved IPv6 handling.

## Website

Torusrxxx also added partial webp support to the content sanitation
(filters), so you can now use webp images on freesites and depending
on the study reduce the storage by around 30%. Minimizing storage is
more critical on Hyphanet compared to the clearnet, so webp can
improve performance for all sites. Animation and lossless mode are not
supported yet.

In addition to webp, Torusrxxx also added support for more CSS
keywords: border-{top,bottom}-{left,right}-radius, color-scheme,
dominant-baseline, margin-block, margin-block-end, margin-block-start,
margin-bottom, margin-inline, margin-inline-end, margin-inline-start,
margin-right, math-style, padding-block, padding-block-end,
padding-block-start, padding-inline, padding-inline-end,
padding-inline-start, padding-right, padding-right, padding-top,
padding-top, scroll-behavior, scroll-snap-align, scroll-snap-stop,
scroll-snap-type, text-combine-upright, text-decoration-thickness,
text-orientation, text-underline-offset.

And font settings: monospace, system-ui, ui-serif, ui-sans-serif,
ui-monospace, ui-rounded, emoji, math, fangsong. Color keywords are
now checked case insensitively.

Also add more CSS selectors: default, disabled, empty, enabled,
focus-visible, indeterminate, in-range, invalid, only-child,
only-of-type, optional, out-of-range, placeholder-shown, read-only,
read-write, required, root. The combination of `:root` and
color-scheme enables settings for dark-mode. The MIME types
image/avif, heic, and heif are now known (but have no validation). Ban
link as well as visited (these can cause requests depending on
interaction), replace with `any-link`. The HTML elements bdi,
figcaption, figure, main, mark, rp, rt, ruby are added.

And the `:checked` selector is now supported, so freesites can have
some CSS-based interactivity.

There’s one loss: Chrome removed Theora support in 2024 and Firefox
followed suit in version 130 (which [broke brasilian banking OTPs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1930548) ).
Firefox ESR (128) will still get support until may 27th 2025. Until
then we need sanitation for modern video formats like vp8 or vp9 and
webm to keep our video on demand (streaming) working.

## User experience

There are two improvements of the interface itself: Qupo1 updated the
Japanese localization and bertm polished the bookmark editor and
directory listing in the Winterfacey theme.

And thanks to Bombe the Freemail plugin now has a settings page for
the SMTP and IMAP address and port to use.

The defunct new load management statistics are now gone — thanks to
Torusrxxx. These were just distracting.

When you change the auto-updater key, updates are now checked
instantly, not only after update (for example to get updates via a
testing key for checking an update before release).

And a bug was fixed that could lead to plugins being killed early
during shutdown.

## Cleanups

Thanks to qupo1, Christophe, and Bombe, our gradle setup is more up to
date and cleaner.

And thanks to Bombe, Bertm, Venfernand, and Juiceman we purged a lot
of outdated code that is no longer needed on modern JVMs (the code
base once had to work with Java 1) or replaced it with more recent
paradigms. Those make it quite a bit more enjoyable to work with the
affected parts of the code.

Finally qupo1 fixed links and code badges in our readme and Bertm made
sure that our IPv6 preference setting keeps working in Java 24 and
later.

## What is Freenet / Hyphanet?

Hyphanet is the original Freenet,  
a peer-to-peer platform for  
censorship-resistant and privacy-respecting  
publishing and communication.

That Hyphanet can keep moving forward and help people worldwide to
exercise their basic rights and freedoms is the work of amazing
volunteers, both contributors and people running Hyphanet nodes.

Thank you for your contributions, and thank you for using Freenet / Hyphanet!
