## Developers

If you already have a contribution in mind you can find the project repositories
[on GitHub](https://github.com/freenet/).

- Get in contact in the [mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists)
- Join us on IRC: [#freenet on chat.freenode.net](help.html#irc)
- Report issues in the [bug tracker](https://bugs.freenetproject.org/)

The Wiki contains a list of 
[freenet-related projects](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Projects) 
and documentation of the 
[Freenet Client Protocol](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/FCPv2)
for using Freenet from external programs.

We're happy to accept pull requests on GitHub as well as patches sent under a
pseudonym through Freenet forums such as [FMS](http://freesocial.draketo.de/fms_en.html).
