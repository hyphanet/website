## Developers

If you already have a contribution in mind you can find the project repositories
[on GitHub](https://github.com/hyphanet/).

- Get in contact in the [mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists)
- Chat with us on IRC: <a href="https://web.libera.chat/?nick=FollowRabbit|?#freenet" id="chatlink" class="btn button-custom btn-custom-two">#freenet @ irc.libera.chat</a>
- Report issues in the [bug tracker](https://freenet.mantishub.io/) hosted by [MantisHub](https://www.mantishub.com)

To get into development right-away, have a look at one of the [Hyphanet-Projects](https://github.com/hyphanet/wiki/wiki/Projects),
check the [starting issues](https://freenet.mantishub.io/view_all_bug_page.php?filter=66d982d217075) in the bug tracker,
or just get [fred](https://github.com/hyphanet/fred) and fix something that annoys you.

Alternatively get the documentation of the 
[Hyphanet Client Protocol](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/FCPv2)
and use Hyphanet as distributed backend for an external program.

If you want to tackle something that makes a big difference, have a look at the [high-impact tasks](https://github.com/hyphanet/wiki/wiki/High-Impact-tasks).

We're happy to accept [pull requests](https://github.com/hyphanet/fred/pulls) on GitHub as well as patches sent under a
pseudonym through Hyphanet forums such as [FMS](http://freesocial.draketo.de/fms_en.html).
