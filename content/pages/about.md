Hyphanet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and
publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Hyphanet) and chat on
forums, without fear of censorship. Hyphanet is decentralised to make it less
vulnerable to attack, and if used in “darknet” mode, where users only connect to
their friends, is very difficult to detect.

Communications by Hyphanet nodes are encrypted and routed through other
nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the
information and what its content is.

Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their
hard drive (called the "data store") for storing encrypted chunks of data. 
Information is kept or deleted depending on the last time they were downloaded. 
Least accessed information is discarded to make way for other content.
This forms a privacy-preserving encrypted caching proxy. Chat, blogs, forums,
websites, radio streaming, are all built on top of this distributed
data store.

Hyphanet has been downloaded many millions of times since the project started,
and used for the distribution of censored information all over the world
including countries such as China and in the Middle East. Ideas and concepts
pioneered in Hyphanet have had a significant impact in the academic world. 
We maintain a selection of [papers about Hyphanet](#papers).

Hyphanet has named its friend-to-friend mode "darknet" long before
this became a widespread term. By only connecting to people they
trust, users can greatly reduce their vulnerability, and yet still
connect to a global network through their friends' friends' friends.

### The importance of the Free flow of information

Freedom of speech, in most western cultures, is generally considered to be one
of the most important rights any individual might have. Why is the freedom to
share ideas and opinions so important? There are several ways to answer this
question.

### Communication is what makes us human

One of the most important abilities of humans
is our ability to communicate sophisticated and abstract concepts. While
we constantly discover that animal's communication ability is more sophisticated
than previously assumed, it is unlikely that any other animal approaches our own
level of ability in this area.

### Knowledge is good

Most people, given the option of knowing something and not knowing something,
will choose to have more information rather than less. Being better-informed allows
us to make better decisions, and generally improve our ability to survive and be
successful.

### Democracy assumes a well informed population

Many people today live under democratic governments, and those who don't,
probably want to. It gives the population the power to regulate their 
government through voting,
Yet the ability to vote does not necessarily mean that you live in a
democratic country. For a population to regulate their government effectively
it must know what their government is doing, they must be well informed. It
is a feedback loop, but this loop can be broken if the government has the
power to control the information the population has access to.

### The solution

The only way to ensure that a democracy will remain effective is to ensure
that the government cannot control its population's ability to share
information, to communicate. So long as everything we can see and hear is
filtered, we are not truly free. Hyphanet's aim is to allow two people
who wish to share information, to do so.

### Isn't censorship sometimes necessary?

No issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that
censorship is a good thing in some circumstances.
For example Governments seek to prevent people from seeing
ideas which are deemed damaging to society.

There are two answers to this. The first is that
you can't allow those in power to impose "good" censorship, without also
enabling them to impose "bad" censorship. Imposing any form of censorship
requires the ability to monitor and thus restrict all communication.

The second argument is that "good" censorship is counter-productive even
when it does not leak into other areas.
Preventing people from being aware of some arguments
makes them vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually
encounter them. Therefore those who seek those arguments must be able to find them.

To prevent censorship by drowning out information with noise, Hyphanet
enables people to choose by themselves what they want to be exposed
to.

### But why is anonymity necessary?

You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous.
Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail free
speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than preventing
them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent this is to
remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot trust
anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital signatures
people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can
learn to trust. Hyphanet facilitates this with stable secret-key based
Pseudonyms.
