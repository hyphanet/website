Foundation.


## OS X

Download and run [the installer][url_mac_installer] ([gpg signature][url_mac_installer_sig]; [keyring][url_keyring]).

[Download Hyphanet for OSX][url_mac_installer]{: .download-button}

It will automatically install Hyphanet and other required components for you.
When done, your default browser will automatically open up to Hyphanet's web-based user interface.

![]({static}/assets/img/mactray/osx_installer_step2_transparent.png)

Hyphanet requires OS X 10.8 or later.

## GNU/Linux & POSIX

Try the [Java Web Start installer][url_jnlp_installer].

[Download Hyphanet for GNU/Linux & POSIX][url_jnlp_installer]{: .download-button}

Now follow the installer:

![]({static}/assets/img/install/1-langselect.png)

If it doesn't work:

You need to have a recent **Java Runtime Environment** (JRE). We have
experienced best results with Oracle's Java Runtime Environment which can be
obtained via your [package manager](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) or from [
http://www.java.com/](http://www.java.com/).

Java version 7 or higher is required, and version 8 or higher is strongly
recommended. You should keep Java up to date to avoid problems and for better
performance.

Open a terminal and run:

    wget 'https://github.com/hyphanet/fred/releases/download/build01501/new_installer_offline_1501.jar' -O new_installer_offline.jar;
    java -jar new_installer_offline.jar;

To install on a headless system, or if you get fontconfig problems, use the `-console` option and follow the prompts:

    java -jar new_installer_offline.jar -console;

Alternatively, downloading [the installer][url_nix_installer]
([gpg signature][url_nix_installer_sig]; [keyring][url_keyring])
and then clicking on the file may work on some systems, but if there are
problems we recommend the above command lines. If wget is not installed,
it can be installed with a package manager, such as `sudo apt-get install wget`
on Debian or Ubuntu.

**Note**: Many GNU/Linux distributions no longer ship with Java Web Start
enabled. We would like to make distribution packages for easier installation,
and have an in-development (and not maintained) [Debian package](
https://github.com/hyphanet/fred/pull/774), but haven't gotten it stable or made
official ones for other distributions. If you are a developer and would like
to join us and help it would be much appreciated!

## Release Mirror

If you cannot access our official releases, you can try the
[http mirror][url_mirror_lysator] or the [tor mirror][url_mirror_lysator_tor] 
provided by [Lysator][url_lysator].

## Mirrored installation

If you have a working Hyphanet installation directory that you have mirrored
from one Unix machine to another (e.g. via rsync or unison), enabling the
mirrored installation is not difficult. Nothing in a Hyphanet installation
cares about its host's IP address; it can't, or Hyphanet would fail on
machines that get IP addresses from a DHCP pool.

All you actually need to do is tell the system you've mirrored to that it
should start the Hyphanet proxy daemon for you on boot. Do `crontab -l`
on the source machine, find the line that is tagged "FREENET AUTOSTART" and
add that to your crontab on the mirrored machine.

However: each installation has a unique identity key generated at
installation time. If you try to run two instances with the same identity _at
the same time_, both proxy demons will become confused and upset. Don't do
this!

## Using Hyphanet

Please try the [step by step guide][url_freesocial] to setting up Hyphanet and various Hyphanet apps,
especially if installing on OS X.
We are not responsible for unofficial third party apps it recommends (including FMS),
but many Hyphanet users and developers use them.

### Firewalls and routers

Hyphanet should work fine with most routers, but if you are having problems
and you have a firewall or router, click [**here**](help.html#firewall) for
some info.

### So it's running, what do I do?

When the installer closes, it should open a browser window pointing to the
first-time wizard. Here you can configure basic settings, and then start
using Hyphanet. You can access Hyphanet later on via the system tray menu (
bottom right on the screen), or use the Browse Hyphanet shortcut on the
desktop and/or start menu. If it doesn't work, open
[http://127.0.0.1:8888/](http://127.0.0.1:8888/) in your web browser.

For best security you should use a separate browser for Hyphanet, preferably
in privacy mode. On Windows, the system tray menu will try to use Chrome in
incognito mode if possible. Internet Explorer does not work well with
Hyphanet, Firefox and Opera are widely used.

If you know anyone running Hyphanet, you can improve your security and help to
build a robust network by connecting to their node. First, open the [Add a
friend page](http://127.0.0.1:8888/addfriend/). You and your friend should
each download their "node reference". Send the file to the other person,
and add his node reference using the form at the bottom of the page. When
both are added, your friend's node should show up on the Friends page,
probably as "CONNECTED" or "BUSY". You can set a name for your node on the
config page to make it easier to see who it is. Only add nodes run by people
**you actually know**, whether online or offline, as adding total strangers
harms performance and does not improve security much (they could be the bad
guys!).

### So I'm connected, what do I do?

Hyphanet itself includes anonymous websites ("freesites"), filesharing,
searching, and more, but you can also use third party applications for chat,
filesharing, to help you upload freesites, etc.

The [Hyphanet Social Networking Guide](http://freesocial.draketo.de/) explains
how to set up the main third party tools, including email, forums and
micro-blogging (Sone, a bit like twitter).

### It doesn't work, now what?

If you have problems installing or running Hyphanet, please see the [knowledge base][kb_url], [FAQ][faq_url], [chat][chat_url], or [mailing list][ml_url].

### Hardware requirements

Generally a 1GHz processor and 1GB of RAM should be fine. Hyphanet will run on
smaller systems, but it uses at least 128MB of RAM, so unless the system does
nothing else it will struggle in less than 512MB. However, the processor is
less of a problem, people have been known to run it on 400MHz Pentium 2's or
ATOM's, although downloads and browsing would be slow.

Hyphanet will use a portion of your disk for storing data, you can configure
this to any size from 100MB upwards, but we recommend at least 1GB. Hyphanet
also uses disk space for your downloads. Hyphanet's memory usage is
approximately 256MB plus 400kB for every 2GB of datastore.

On 64-bit Windows, we will install a 32-bit Java Virtual Machine because of
limitations of the [Java Service Wrapper](
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/download.jsp).

### Upgrading

Hyphanet provides an upgrade-over-Hyphanet mechanism: It will keep itself up to
date automatically from other Hyphanet nodes, and this will normally work even
if it is unable to route to them due to them being too new. This is anonymous
and secure, and we recommend people use it. However, if something is severely
broken, you can upgrade your node manually from our servers:

* Windows users can upgrade to the latest-stable Hyphanet release
  by running "update.cmd" in the Hyphanet directory.
* OS X, GNU/Linux, or other POSIX users may upgrade by running the update.sh
  shell script in the Hyphanet directory.

## Add friends (or connect to strangers)

If you know other people who also use Hyphanet, you can [add them as Friends][url_addfriend].
This will make you safer against attacks on Hyphanet Project infrastructure
(the [seednodes][url_seednode_info]).

Once you are connected to 5 or more friends, you can enable **high security mode**.
In high security mode Hyphanet will only connect to your friends.
This makes your usage of Hyphanet almost undetectable,
but you are still able to access the rest of the network through your friends' friends friends ....

You don't have to add friends right now.
If you use a "low" or "normal" security level Hyphanet will automatically connect to strangers and will work just fine.
However, your (or someone else's) government may be able to find out who you are with enough effort. Be careful!
