title:  Freenet / Hyphanet build 1501: address performance regression and merged PRs

Freenet / Hyphanet 0.7.5 build 1501 is now available.

> **Install Freenet / Hyphanet** for **[Windows][windows-installer]**, for **[GNU/Linux, macOS and other *nixes][linux-installer]**, or for **[Android][android-package]**. See the [download page][download page] for more information and other platforms (Apple Silicon needs library updates to work).

The main purpose of this release is to address a regression in backoff in 1500.

<div style="float: right; width: 30%; max-width: 300px;"><img src="./theme/images/logo-large.png" width="100%" style="filter: invert(30%)"  /></div>

The regression came from handling a bulk request with 10% probability if there is a realtime request.
This was a fix for very fast nodes. Previously high rates of realtime requests could starve the bulk requests.
But the change caused higher backoff, because the fraction of bulk requests and average delays for realtime requests increased.

In addition, a bugfix to slow request handling had caused nodes to actually back off (pause their requests) when bulk requests became too slow.
This was erroneously ignored before.

Both changes together caused fluctuating backoff that also showed up in the fetchpull stats as doubled latency:

![Request latency for 100k files tracked over time with averages for files uploaded the same day, files uploaded one day before, and files uploaded 32 days before]({static}/assets/img/2025-02-22-fetchpull-get-bulk.png)


The fix is to reduce the probability to choose bulk instead of realtime to 2%
and to remove an artificial minimum for the retransmission timeout.
This should speed up request handling and reduce backoff.
And reduced backoff increases the efficiency of routing.

We could track down the issue and test improvements mainly thanks to testing by max_iops. Thank you!


In addition to addressing the regression we merged safe improvements
people had submitted in the meantime:

Code and performance improvements:

- avoid reflection and global synchronized in fileutils and use NIO for improved performance. Thanks to bertm!
- use the java 8 datetime utils and remove the deprecated Calendar. Thanks to bertm!
- only log errors for invalid recently failed values if those values are invalid in all supported versions.
- split up parsing peers to be easier to understand
- improve crypt tests that fail in Gradle on some Java versions but not in IntelliJ

Freesite UI:

- enable using CSS properties border-block/inline-start/end-color/style/width, border-end/start-end/start-radius. Thanks to torusrxxx!

Bugfixes:

- fix usk date hints: failed for a week spanning over two years. Thanks to bertm!


Thank you for using Hyphanet!
